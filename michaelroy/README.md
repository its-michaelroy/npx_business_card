## SHA-1 Checksum

To verify the integrity of the package, you can use the following SHA-1 checksum:
```bash
0d65463c6944b463a1ad44cf87d468f1a91ba8ae
```

## Verifying the SHA-1 Checksum

Follow the steps below according to your operating system to verify the SHA-1 checksum:

### üêß For Linux:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file (optional):
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

3. Calculate the SHA-1 checksum:
```bash
sha1sum filename
```

### üçè For macOS:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file (optional):
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

3. Calculate the SHA-1 checksum:

```

### ü™ü+üêß For Windows WSL:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file (optional):
```cmd
cd /path/to/directory
```

3. Calculate the SHA-1 checksum:
```cmd
certutil -hashfile filename SHA1
```

## If the checksums match, the package has not been tampered with.
```bash
sha1 0d65463c6944b463a1ad44cf87d468f1a91ba8ae
